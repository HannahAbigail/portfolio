<h1>Hannah LaFramboise at Girls Who Code - UIC Ada Lovelace SIP 2017</h1>

  <h2>Week 1</h2>
  <p>I learned the basics of how to use Scratch. I made a paddle ball game in which I used variables, loops, and conditionals. I also made a side scroller game with a group of people. In that we used conditionals, loops, and variables.</p>
  
  <h2>Week 2</h2>
  <p>I learned the fundamentals of Python and how to make lists in Python. I used this knowledge to make an Obamicon and greyscale filter that I'm able to use on a photo to change its colors.</p>

  <h2>Week 3</h2>
  <p>I learned how to use a breadboard, arduino, servos, whisker wires, and piezos in a robot and its applications. It was very difficult because each piece had to be placed exactly in the correct position, but my group and I eventually got our robot to move in a square, blink red and blue lights, play a siren sound, and sense its environment.</p>
  
  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  <p>I further developed my personal portfolio by creating a wire frame and learning how I can incorporate bootstrape into it. I also went on fieldtrips to the Adler Planetarium, Isobar, and Accenture.</p>
